/*
Cyborg Data Type Sizes
You have been given a job as a programmer on a Cyborg supercomputer. In order to
accomplish some calculations, you need to know how many bytes the following data
types use: char , int , float , and double . You do not have any manuals, so you can�t
look this information up. Write a C++ program that will determine the amount of
memory used by these types and display the information on the screen.
